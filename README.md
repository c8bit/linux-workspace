#linux-workspace
This is a set of rc and config files for my personal preferred linux workspace. I use this repo to clone my workspace settings to any computer I work on, and I update it as often as I update those files. Feel free to use the structure and scripts, and remove/change the files so you can do the same for your workspace!! ^__^

##Quick Start
* Copy the appropriate files.
```
git clone https://github.com/c8bit/linux-workspace.git /wherever/you/want
```
* Run the installer.
```
/path/to/linux-workspace/install.sh
```

##Licensing

NOTE: I DID NOT WRITE any of the following config files for the 'Solarized' color scheme:
```
./vim/colors/solarized.vim
./config/X11/solarized-dark
./config/X11/solarized-light
```
Credits for the 'Solarized' theme go to [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).
